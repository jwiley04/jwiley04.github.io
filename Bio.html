   “Forget about the fast lane. If you really want to fly, harness your power to your passion. Honor your calling. Everybody has one. Trust your heart, and success will come to you,” Oprah Winfrey. I am convinced that each and every individual has a destiny in life. Whether it is to become an artist, astronaut, chef, entrepreneur, professional driver, technician, and so forth. I believe that we all have an impulse, and not the kind that most psychiatrist diagnosis as a disorder. It is the essence that compels us to persevere through all trials and tribulations. My obsession for science and technology stems from a young age. My journey to where I am today can easily be seen through my education and work experience.
